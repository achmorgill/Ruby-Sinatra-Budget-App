# Ruby-Sinatra-Budget-App

This is a personal Budget website written in Ruby using the Sinatra website and a Postgress database

This application was written at the start of a digital coding course at Codeclan and the code is not Solid.  I am aware
that the code needs refactoring as there is duplication of code.
